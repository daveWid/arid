h1. Arid

The Arid Wordpress plugin allows for rapid DRY theme development.

Wordpress is very good at doing content management, but as a developer creating
themes is a pain in the ass. This plugin uses the MV of MVC (Wordpress is the controller)
to allow for better organization of themes.

Arid uses a small subset of the "Kohana Framework":http://www.kohanaframework.org
